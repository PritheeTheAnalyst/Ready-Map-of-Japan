# Ready-Map-of-Japan-QGIS
## Project Description
This project shows how QGIS software can be used to transform raw GIS layers into clear, beautiful and useful ready map. I created a map of Japan that is useful and complete with standard cartographic elements. Thus, aiding reporting and decision making for stakeholders.
## Purpose of the Project
Maps are more than just visual aid, they help in communication, and reporting, thriving towards better decision making. My aim was to design an informative and clear map of Japan that is suitable for presentation.
## Dataset Used
The project used publicly available geographic data that includes base map layers for Japan. All datasets were reviewed to ensure correct alignment and consistency within a unified coordinate reference system.
## Software & Tools
- QGIS
- Natural Earth Quickstart Kit
