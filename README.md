# Spatial-Visualization-Japan-QGIS
## Project Description
This project shows how QGIS software can be used to transform raw GIS layers, basic mappings into clear, beautiful and useful spatial visualisation. I created a map of Japan that is useful and complete with standard cartographic elements. Thus, aiding reporting and decision making for stakeholders.

## Purpose of the Project
Maps are more than just visual aid, they help in communication, and reporting, thriving towards better decision making. My aim as a geospatial analyst was to design an informative and clear map of Japan that is suitable for presentation.

## Dataset Used
The project used publicly available geographic data that includes base map layers for Japan. All datasets were reviewed to ensure correct alignment and consistency within a unified coordinate reference system.

## Software & Tools
- QGIS
- Natural Earth Quickstart Kit
- QGIS Expressions

## Spatial Visualization of Japan

## Map Preparation in QGIS
Japan Plane Rectangular CS which is a spatial Reference System was utilised as it useful for minimum distortions. All layers were properly added, edited, and styled while designing the map layout. This includes the correct CRS, configuring grids, defining coordinates, customizing expressions, adjusting map insets, appropriate symbols and shapes to adhere to clarity of visuals at the layout stage. 
At the final stage, the scale, frame, and labels were modified and perfected. 

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Map design
- Spatial communication
- GIS layout production
- Attention to cartographic detail

## Project Insights and Conclusion
This project reflects how QGIS can be used as a tool to communicate spatial information clearly. Also, QGIS is effecient in creating informative geographical visualization using elements like inset, girds, expressions, and layers.
